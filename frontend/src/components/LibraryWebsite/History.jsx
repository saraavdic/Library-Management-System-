          <p>The City Library was founded in 1950 with a mission to make knowledge accessible to everyone. Over the years, it has grown from a small reading room into a modern cultural and educational center. The library now houses thousands of books, journals, and digital resources covering a wide range of subjects. It serves as a welcoming space for students, researchers, and community members alike. Regular workshops, lectures, and exhibitions are organized to promote lifelong learning and creativity. The library's digital collection allows users to access information from anywhere, bridging the gap between tradition and technology. Special programs are offered for children and seniors to encourage reading and social interaction. Dedicated librarians and staff ensure that every visitor finds the resources they need. The City Library also collaborates with schools and universities to support education and research. Today, it continues to inspire curiosity, foster community connections, and uphold its original mission of sharing knowledge with all.</p>
